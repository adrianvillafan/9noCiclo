This directory contains the codes corresponding to the numerical experiments of the paper:

O. P. Ferreira, M. S. Louzeiro, and L. F. Prudente, "Gradient Method for Optimization 
on Riemannian Manifolds with Lower Bounded Curvature", technical report, 2018.

The following files are contained in this directory:
  
  Readme	   - User guide.
  main.m	   - Driver for the optimization code. Define in main.m file the 
		     strategy used by the Riemannian gradient method, and the problem
	             to be solved.
  evalf.m	   - Subroutine which implements the objective functions of the problems.
  evalg.m          - Subroutine which implements the Euclidian gradient of the objective 
                     functions.
  GradRiemannian.m - Subroutine which contains the Riemannian gradient method.
  Gradient.m	   - Subroutine which contains the Euclidian gradient method.


Instructions:
—————————————

1) Edit the main.m file to choose the strategy used by the 
   Riemannian gradient method, and the problem to be solved.

2) Run typing

main

at the Command Window, and see the output in the screen.
